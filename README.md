# Deaf Sinatra 1 Synchronous Forms

## Learning Competencies

* use URL parameters to pass data into a server application
* use form controls to pass data into a server application
* use ruby flow control to change server response
* use redirect
* navigate and modify multi-file, multi-directory code base
* map the flow of data through a web application
* use redirect to append output to an existing page

## Summary

We're going to build our first and very simple web application using
[Sinatra][], a lightweight framework for building web
applications in Ruby.

This challenge is basically a web version of Deaf Grandma.

## Releases

### Release 0: Download the Skeleton Code

Use the skeleton code provided in `source/deaf_grandma`.  Change into that
directory and run `bundle` to install the necessary gems.  Note that this
application uses Postgres for its database, not SQLite.  If there's a
database-related error at any point grab a staff member to make sure the
machine is configured correctly and Postgres is running.

Establish databases required by the skeleton: `rake db:create` and `rake
db:migrate` as well as `rake db:test:prepare`.  We won't actually use the
database or ActiveRecord backed models in this challenge, but we will for
pretty much every other challenge so we might as well get used to typing these
words now :).

To launch the web application this command from the application root directory:

```text
$ shotgun config.ru
```

Sinatra, like Rails, is a [Rack-based](http://rack.github.com/) framework,
which means the main point of entry is this `config.ru` file.  The `ru` stands
for "rackup."

You should now be able to visit your web app at
[http://localhost:9393](http://localhost:9393).  `localhost` always refers to
"the current machine," so you actually have a tiny web server running on your
own computer!

It should look like this:

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/0b1O350M1Z1P2i353B3I/Screen%20Shot%202013-02-17%20at%202.58.54%20PM.png"></p>

If it looks different call a staff member over!

### Release 1: Make Grandma Talk

First, visit
[http://localhost:9393/?grandma=hey!](http://localhost:9393/?grandma=hey!).
Notice how the value of the URL parameter `grandma` is rendered on the page.
Try to find where in the code this logic exists.  How do we extract information
from the URL parameters?

The string after a URL that looks like `?param1=value1&param2=value2` is called
a **query string**, and it contains the parameters of the request.

Load up the web app, type something into the talk-to-Grandma box, and click
"Say it!"  What happens and why?

### Release 2:  Make Grandma Logical

Finally, change `app/controllers/index.rb` so that Grandma response
appropriately.  If you typed in something in ALL CAPS make her respond
humorously.  If you typed in something else make her response with "Speak up,
kiddo!"

Read the [Sinatra documentation][] on [browser redirect][] and the [handlers
section][] of the [Sinatra Book][].  You'll want to redirect back to
`http://localhost:9292/?grandma=foobar` after the user submits their form.

### Release 3: Controller Testing

You should be able to run `rspec` now to verify the skeleton specs.

![green rspec run text](running_specs.png "Successful RSpec run")

Your first challenge is to add a **controller** spec which verifies
that when you submit a lower-cased string that your application returns your
humorous response.  Controller tests are one of the most heavily-used parts of
the Rails framework and it's important that you understand how to test them.

### Submit your code!

Only your `index.rb` file should have changed.  Create a pull request back
